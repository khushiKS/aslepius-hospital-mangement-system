        <h1>KIDNEY PAIN VS. BACK PAIN: HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE</h1>
        <p>According to various data banks, the overall prevalence of low back pain was found to be 42% in India. Kidney problems too result in back pain which may be a little different from musculoskeletal back pain. In today’s write up we will find out how to differentiate between the two.</p>
        <p>Each person has got a pair of kidneys located posteriorly on the lower side of the abdomen. The kidney purifies blood for nutrients and discharges urine.</p>
        <h3>How to differentiate kidney pain from general backache:</h3>
        <h4>1. Location</h4>
        <p>As is the location of kidneys the pain will be felt on the posterior (behind) lower side of the abdomen usually on one side (the side whichever kidney is involved). It may rarely occur on both sides too. Musculoskeletal back pain is usually felt around the lumbar region, it may pain while muscles are touched. However musculoskeletal back pain can be felt all through the back as well.</p>
        <h4>2. Radiation of pain</h4>
        <p>Kidney pain may radiate to the inner thigh or lower abdomen. Musculoskeletal back pain due to disc or nerve impingement may radiate to buttocks, back of the thigh, laterally to leg and ankles too.</p>
        <h4>3. Type of pain</h4>
        <p> Mostly a constant steep pain(stones) or dull aching pain( infection). The kidney stone pain may vary as the stone moves. The musculoskeletal back pain is mostly coming and going, peaking after high-intensity work and better with rest. Pain here too is dull aching.</p>
        <h4>4. The severity of pain</h4>
        <p>Mostly a constant steep severs pain (stones) or mild aching pain (infection). The musculoskeletal back pain is not very severe.</p>
        <h4>5. Relief</h4>
        <p> No relief unless the stone moves or underlying cause is treated. The musculoskeletal back pain feels better with rest, local applications, heat, and cold.</p>
        <h4>6. Symptoms of both:</h4>

            <li>inability to move from the bed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Causes of Kidney pain:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>stress and strain on back tissue like muscle or ligament-like during overstretching, lifting excessive weight, or using incorrect lifting practices</li>

            <li>shingles</li>
            <li>cancer of the spine</li>

        <h3>When to seek medical advice?</h3>
        <p>In case of kidney pain, as indicated through symptoms, immediate medical advice should be taken to get rid of the underlying cause. Musculoskeletal pain can be treated in the house through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Over the counter pain meds and muscle relaxants</li>
            <li>Rest</li>
            <li>Ice or Heat (based on acute or chronic)</li>
        </ul>

            <li>bony protrusion from the back</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The whole purpose of the write-up is early distinction detection of kidney issues. The prognosis of both kidney and musculoskeletal problems is way better with early detection than a delayed diagnosis. A famous person once said, ‘Awareness levels the playing field. We are all humans doing the best we can’.</p>
