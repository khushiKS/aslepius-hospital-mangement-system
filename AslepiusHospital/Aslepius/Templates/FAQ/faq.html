  <p>The arteries that supply blood to the heart muscles sometimes get clogged by plaques (a build up of fat, cholesterol and other substances). This slows down or stops regular blood flow through the heart's blood vessels, leading to chest pain or 'Heart Attack'. Heart Bypass Surgery is a type of surgery, where the blood flow is 'rerouted or bypassed' around the clogged arteries to improve the blood flow and oxygen to the heart.</p>

<button class="accordion">What is Angiography?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Angiography is an X-Ray examination of the blood vessels - called 'arteries'.
To make the arteries visible on X-Ray, a type of dye called "contrast" is injected.
A small, sterile flexible tube called a 'catheter' is inserted into the arterial system, usually in the region of the groin, where the artery is close to the skin and can be compressed when necessary against the hip bone situated immediately behind it. Sometimes other areas such as the arms are used. Contrast is then injected into the blood vessels and X-Ray images are obtained.</p>
